    <p>
    openQA was originally developed by Bernhard M. Wiedemann
    &lt;bernhard+osautoinst ät lsmod de&gt; with contributions from Dominik
    Heidler &lt;dheidler ät suse de&gt;. Both are still very active and
    prominent members of the openQA community, but the development effort is
    nowadays shared with many other hands coordinated by means of a
    <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/openqav3">project in the
    openSUSE's project management tool</a>. That's the best place to take a look
    at the roadmap and the development progress, as well as the best place to
    report bugs or reach the developers in general.

    If you are looking for help or want to contribute, find the community on
    Matrix in
    <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#openqa:opensuse.org">https://matrix.to/#/#openqa:opensuse.org</a>
    or Discord in the "#openqa" channel on the
    <a href="https://discord.gg/opensuse">openSUSE Discord</a> presence.
    Both rooms (Matrix+Discord) are bridged so every message is visible in
    the other room and vice versa. Another good place with active users is
    the
    <a href="irc://irc.opensuse.org/openSUSE-factory">#openSUSE-factory
    channel</a> at irc.opensuse.org (currently pointing to libera.chat).
    It can also be a good idea to subscribe to the
    <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/">opensuse-factory
    mailing list</a> for some openQA related traffic.
